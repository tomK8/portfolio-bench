# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code in this repository. Prefer reading the code; this file covers the
cross-cutting bits that aren't obvious from any single file.

This file is intentionally detailed. Helps remember various things we have done. Does not
seem to be wasting too many context tokens.

## Build, test & run

```bash
mvn compile                            # compile
mvn test                               # excludes @Tag("integration")
mvn test -Dtest=AJBellSippParserTest   # single class
mvn package -DskipTests                # jar
mvn spring-boot:run                    # foreground (dev)
scripts/start.sh / scripts/stop.sh     # daemon (writes ~/log/portfolio-bench.log)
```

Server binds to loopback only, no auth — single-user local tool. Override directories with
`--portfolio.input-dir=…`, `--portfolio.db-dir=…`, `--portfolio.output-dir=…` (blank → defaults
`~/Downloads`, `~/Documents/Investing`, `~/Documents`).

Daemon mode: `start.sh` backgrounds `target/portfolio-bench-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`, writes a PID file,
rotates the previous log to a timestamped name. The JVM's stdout/stderr is redirected into the
log file, so non-Logback output (early classloader errors, OOM dumps) is captured too.
`spring.main.banner-mode=log` routes the Spring banner through SLF4J.

### Test fixtures

`src/test/resources/` **must contain only synthetic data — no real brokerage exports.** Fixtures
are committed so parser tests can load files from disk. Real exports were never committed; keep
it that way. Regenerate `Holdings.xlsx` with openpyxl if its shape needs to change.

## Architecture

Spring Boot web app, layered ports-and-adapters. **Spring is confined to `web` and `config`**;
`domain`, `application`, `adapter`, `parser` and `persistence` are framework-free.

- `domain` — pure logic. `PortfolioAggregator` (two-pass: `groupAccumulators` →
  `buildAggHolding`), `PortfolioMetrics` (totals + `rtTotalGbp` for intraday valuation),
  `DividendAttributor` (FIFO), `CashLedgerReconstructor` (FIFO position-from-ledger
  reconstruction for the cash-ledger view), `Instruments.isBond` (single home of the
  bond/gilt predicate). `domain.model`: `Holding` (Builder; many nullable fields),
  `AggHolding`, `CashTransaction`, `Account` + `TransactionType` enums, `PriceBar`,
  `IntradayBar`, `IntradayPrice`.
- `port` — `FxRateProvider`, `HistoricalFxRateProvider` (interfaces, faked in tests).
- `adapter` — `FrankfurterFxClient` (Jackson + shared HttpClient with timeouts),
  `HoldingFileLocator`, `YahooPriceFetcher`, `YahooTickerMap`.
- `parser` — `AccountParser` / `CashTransactionParser` interfaces + impls.
- `persistence` — `JdbcConnectionFactory` + its repositories + `KeyValueStore`. See below.
- `application` — `PortfolioGatherer`, `SyncPortfolioService`, `SyncFromCashService`
  (cash-ledger-derived view), `ExportExcelService`, `DividendService`,
  `ContributionService` (timeline for the Contributions chart), `PortfolioValueService`
  (timeline for the Value-over-time chart), `ImportCashService` (composes
  `List<CashImporter>`), `PriceFetchJob` + `IntradayPriceFetchJob` (share
  `PriceFetchSupport`).
- `web` — `DashboardController` (thin; `@ExceptionHandler(IllegalStateException)` renders
  `fragments/error` instead of HTTP 500), `PriceFetchScheduler`.
- `config` — `BeanConfiguration`.
- Root — `ExcelReportWriter`, `PortfolioBenchApplication`.

UI: server-rendered Thymeleaf + htmx (CDN) + Chart.js 4 + `chartjs-adapter-date-fns` +
`chartjs-plugin-zoom` (CDN). Dashboard tabs:
- **From holdings files** — `POST /sync` → `fragments/portfolio`. Includes a cash
  reconciliation panel comparing the holdings-side cash (parsed CASH rows + form-supplied
  II SIPP £/$) against the ledger-side latest stored cash balance, with red rows for
  |diff| > £50 (threshold in `SyncPortfolioService.CASH_DRIFT_WARN_GBP`).
- **From cash ledger** — `POST /sync-from-cash` → `fragments/portfolio-ledger`. Slimmer
  table (no separate "Market Value £" / "RT Market Value £" columns — single combined
  value column). Drops positions without an intraday price.
- **Contributions** — `GET /contributions` → JSON, rendered by Chart.js. Cumulative
  per-account + Total.
- **Value over time** — `GET /portfolio-value` → JSON, Chart.js. Monthly portfolio GBP
  value; yellow warning panel above the chart lists symbols that were ever held but
  have zero rows in `price_history`.
- **Allocation** — `GET /allocation` → JSON, three Chart.js panels: cash-vs-invested
  stacked area, per-symbol stacked area (top 12 + "Other"), and a date-picker
  snapshot of the full breakdown on any chosen day. Weekly cadence (~550 samples
  over a 10-year history) via `AllocationService`; latest sample always pinned to
  today so the snapshot reflects current state even mid-week.
- **Attribution** — `GET /attribution?from=YYYY-MM-DD&to=YYYY-MM-DD` → JSON, Chart.js
  horizontal bar + sortable table. Per-symbol GBP P&L over a window via
  `AttributionService` (formula: `end_value − start_value + window_cash_flows`). Each
  row also reports a period return (P&L ÷ peak GBP capital deployed in the window) and
  the same return annualised to 365.25 days. End-value uses live intraday + live FX
  when `to == today`, daily close + historical FX otherwise — so totals reconcile with
  the cash-ledger view.

- **Watchlist** — `GET /watchlist` → JSON, rendered as a table under the Tools group. A
  user-maintained set of symbols (owned or not — *not* unioned with holdings, kept lean by
  design) for volatility trading. Each row joins live price + today's move + trailing
  momentum (5d/30d) + a realized-vol term structure (5D/10D/30D/1Y annualised) + 52-wk
  high/low distances + P/E/beta
  + position/gain (blank when not held). Four per-symbol alert triggers with editable
  thresholds/levels: proximity to the 52-week high, |today's move|, and absolute price
  targets (≥ above and ≤ below, in the price's native currency). Row colour = alert state
  (green/red today-move by direction, blue near-high, amber ≥-target, purple ≤-target,
  pulsing when both near-high + big-move). Click a row for a
  popup: same fields + a price chart with a 1D/3D/5D/10D/15D (intraday) + 30D (daily) window
  toggle + a collapsible Fundamentals section. See the Watchlist section below.

- **Swing stats** — `GET /swing` → JSON, rendered as tables + a correlation heatmap under the
  Tools group. Validation statistics for a short-term mean-reversion (dip-buy) strategy on a
  configurable high-vol semi/AI watchlist: realized-vol term structure; forward returns after
  down-day / flush triggers, always shown next to their unconditional baseline; an OHLC-touch
  barrier / time-stop trade simulation with full TP/SL/Time/Ambiguous/Open accounting, an all-days
  placebo and a matched-random bootstrap (does the flush trigger beat drift?); and cluster
  correlation (incl. tail correlation on down days). Every flush runs for **two trigger families in
  parallel** (§C) — an absolute −% drop and a σ-scaled −k×σ×√N flush that fires at each regime's own
  scale — each with an event log (§A), a per-year breakdown (§B) and a 200d-MA split (§E), in **all**
  and **ex-earnings** variants (§D). Everything is configurable and pooled across a "semi cluster"
  subset (pooled cells report distinct-date *episodes* alongside raw event counts); §9 regime split
  (full vs trailing 6 months) is shown side by side with each name's actual data span. §8 earnings
  hygiene is now active via an EDGAR filing-date proxy (US filers only; others flagged unverified).
  See the Swing section below.

Charts load lazily on first tab click. Logging is SLF4J + Logback (`logback-spring.xml`);
no `System.out` in production code.

## Holding fields

- `currentMarketValue` — native currency amount.
- `currentMarketValueGbp` — pre-converted GBP from the source (AJ Bell does); `null` → convert via FX.
- `costBasisGbp` — GBP cost from the source (AJ Bell only); `null` → compute from `avgPricePaid` via FX.

**FX convention:** rates are *units of foreign currency per 1 GBP* (e.g. `{"USD": 1.3621}`).
To convert native → GBP, **divide** by the rate.

## Persistence

`com.portfolio.persistence` is the single owner of JDBC traffic. All repos route through
`JdbcConnectionFactory`; each repo runs its DDL once in its constructor (not on every read/write).

- `SnapshotRepository` — `portfolio_snapshots` (one row per snapshot date; re-run same day overwrites).
- `CashTransactionRepository` — `cash_transactions`; per-broker save methods (`saveAjBell`,
  `saveRothIra`, `saveII`) hold each broker's dedup + balance-derivation rules. Reads:
  `loadDividendTransactions` (TRANSACTION + DIVIDEND, for dividend FIFO and the cash-ledger
  view), `loadContributions` (CONTRIBUTION-only, for the Contributions chart),
  `loadAllTransactions` (everything in date order, for the Value-over-time forward
  replay), `latestCashBalances` (latest stored cash per `(account, currency)`,
  feeds the cash-ledger view's CASH rows and the holdings view's reconciliation panel),
  `earliestTransactionDate(Account)` (anchors Roth's seed), `distinctTradedSymbols`.
- `PriceHistoryRepository` — `price_history` (daily OHLCV).
- `IntradayPriceRepository` — `price_intraday` (1-min closes). `loadLatestIntradayPrices` is a bulk
  query, not N round-trips.
- `EarningsDateRepository` — `earnings_dates` (§D earnings-proxy cache: one row per `(symbol, date)`;
  reads/cache-fill degrade, never throw).
- `KeyValueStore` — file-backed scalar settings, one `<key>.txt` per key under `<db-dir>`:
  - `ii_sipp_cash_last` — last II SIPP **GBP** cash balance entered on the dashboard.
  - `ii_sipp_cash_last_usd` — last II SIPP **USD** cash balance entered on the dashboard.
    Service converts via current FX before summing into the holdings view's totals.
  - `roth_balance_brought_forward` — RothIRA opening balance in **USD**, used to seed the
    running balance on first import. Charts must convert to GBP via historical FX
    (see `ContributionService.rothSeedAsGbp`, `PortfolioValueService.timeline`) — treating
    the file as GBP would understate the gap substantially.
  - `held_symbols` — newline-separated set of currently-held symbols, written by
    `SyncPortfolioService` after each `/sync`. Unioned with the cash-ledger symbol set in
    `PriceFetchSupport.tickersToFetch` so freshly bought names get an intraday quote before
    their cash statement is imported.

**Account / TransactionType persistence:** the enums map to TEXT columns via `Account.dbValue()`
("AJBell"/"RothIRA"/"II") and `TransactionType.name()`. The SQLite CHECK constraints use the
same literal strings — don't rename enum constants without a migration.

**Write paths throw, reads degrade.** `SnapshotRepository.saveSnapshot` and the three
`CashTransactionRepository.save*` methods throw `IllegalStateException` on failure
(`@ExceptionHandler` renders `fragments/error`). Query methods and background-job inserts
(`savePriceBars`, `saveIntradayBars`) log + return empty/0 — they must not crash the scheduler.

**Migrations:** see `CashTransactionRepository`'s constructor for the idempotent pattern
(`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` + `try { ALTER TABLE … } catch (SQLException ignored) {}`).

## Bond identification

`Instruments.isBond(securityId)` checks for `%` or `GILT` prefix. Single source of truth used to
(1) sort bonds into their own section at the bottom of the Portfolio sheet, (2) skip Yahoo price
fetches (no coverage there), (3) switch the per-£100-nominal value formula (`qty × price / 100`)
in `PortfolioAggregator.realtime`, `SyncFromCashService.realtime` (cash-ledger view), and
`PortfolioValueService.positionGbp` (value chart) — keep these in sync if the bond price model
changes.

Bonds in AJBell exports are normalised to `"GILT {coupon}% {year}"` by `AJBellSippParser.extractBondId`.
The same string is the symbol under which `GiltPriceFetchJob` writes to `price_intraday`, so the
aggregator joins holding → RT price without any ticker translation.

## Dividends

Source: `cash_transactions WHERE type = 'DIVIDEND'` — no separate table, no manual-entry screen.
`DividendService.dividendsBySymbol` runs `DividendAttributor` over the cash ledger (FIFO lot
tracking — see the class doc), reconciles the reconstructed share count against the holdings
file, and logs WARN on disagreement >0.01 shares. Per-symbol amounts flow into `AggHolding`'s
`dividendGbp` / `totalGainGbp` / `totalGainPct`. Portfolio-level totals (`PortfolioMetrics`) are
price-appreciation only — dividends are **not** folded into the saved snapshot.

## Adding a new parser

1. Implement `AccountParser` (`parse`, `supports`, `sourceName`).
2. Register in `PortfolioGatherer` (parsers are built per run, after rates are fetched, because
   `AJBellSippParser` needs the live rates).
3. If the source provides GBP values directly, set `currentMarketValueGbp` + `costBasisGbp` on
   the `Holding`; otherwise leave them null and `PortfolioAggregator` will convert via FX.

File-detection: `Holdings*.xlsx` (Roth), `portfolio*.csv` (AJBell SIPP), UUID `.csv` (II SIPP
holdings; distinguished from II cash by header sniff), `cashstatements*.csv` (AJBell cash),
`History*.xlsx` (Roth cash), UUID `.csv` with `Debit,Credit,Running Balance` header (II cash).

## Adding a new cash source (broker)

1. Implement `CashTransactionParser` (`account()` → `Account` enum, `supports`, `parse`).
2. Add a `CashTransactionRepository.save…` method if the dedup rules differ, else reuse one.
3. Implement `CashImporter` by extending `AbstractCashImporter` (provides `matchingFiles`,
   `mostRecent`, `parse`, `archiveOrDelete`).
4. Register the importer as a bean in `BeanConfiguration`. Spring injects
   `List<CashImporter>` into `ImportCashService` in bean-declaration order, which is the order
   the dashboard shows results.

**Cash dedup keys (one per broker, all cross-file):**
- AJBell: `(transaction_date, type, symbol, amount_gbp)`. AJ Bell can retroactively insert a
  dividend mid-file, which shifts every later row's running balance — so identity is the row
  itself, not its position. Re-importing UPDATEs `cash_balance_gbp` on matching rows.
  Integrity check: if the file's earliest row is newer than every stored AJBell row, the
  import **throws** as a gap (a window has been lost between exports). Legacy duplicates
  from prior (date, balance)-keyed imports are collapsed on next load — highest-rowid wins.
- RothIRA: `(date, symbol, quantity, type, amount)` — native USD amount, FX-stable across
  imports. Balance continues from latest stored `cash_balance`, or the
  `roth_balance_brought_forward` KV seed (USD) on first import.
- II: `(date, type, symbol, amount, currency)` within `account='II'`. The currency component
  isolates the GBP and USD ledgers within the shared account so dividend FIFO still groups by
  `(account, symbol)` across currencies.

## Price history

Two tables, three jobs. `PriceFetchSupport` is shared by the two Yahoo jobs:

- `PriceFetchJob` → `price_history` (daily). First run backfills ~10 years per ticker; later runs
  fetch the gap to today. Cron 22:00 Europe/London + startup.
- `IntradayPriceFetchJob` → `price_intraday` (1-minute closes). **15-day** retention
  (`RETENTION_DAYS`), but the per-tick fetch lookback is capped at `FETCH_LOOKBACK_DAYS` = 7 —
  Yahoo only serves ~7 days of 1-minute history per request, so the 15-day window *accumulates*
  as ticks append rather than backfilling in one shot. Feeds the watchlist popup's 1D–15D
  intraday charts. Pruned after each fetch tick. Every minute + startup.
- `GiltPriceFetchJob` → also `price_intraday`, one HTTP GET to `dividenddata.co.uk/uk-gilts-prices-yields.py`.
  Hourly + startup. Symbols are `"GILT {coupon}% {year}"` (no Yahoo ticker map). Currency `"GBP"`.
  Rides the intraday job's prune for retention. Dividenddata returns 403 to the default Java
  `User-Agent`; `GiltPriceFetcher` sends a browser UA. Each tick also **upserts** today's row
  into `price_history` so the daily series self-accumulates even when the app isn't running
  all day — last-write-wins.
- `ImportGiltPricesService` → bulk historical import for gilts from manually downloaded
  `~/Downloads/Tradeweb_FTSE_ClosePrices*.csv`. Runs on startup (daemon) and on demand via
  `POST /import-gilt-prices`. Upserts into `price_history`, archives consumed files to the
  DB dir as `Tradeweb_{symbol}_{from}_to_{to}.csv` (range comes from the file's own dates,
  not today's). **Never clobbers**: if a target name already exists, appends `_2`, `_3`, ...
  Tradeweb files are manually sourced and irreplaceable, so `REPLACE_EXISTING` is forbidden
  here.

**Gilt price history sources:** two independent feeds writing the same table via the same
upsert. Either can fill or overwrite the other's day. The intraday rollup gives continuous
coverage while the app runs; Tradeweb batch imports give authoritative closes for whatever
range the user downloads — typically the source of truth when both are present.

`PriceFetchSupport.tickersToFetch` builds the universe: every symbol from
`CashTransactionRepository.distinctTradedSymbols()` plus the `held_symbols` KV set persisted by
the most recent `/sync` (covers freshly bought names whose cash statement isn't imported yet —
otherwise their first intraday quote would wait until import). Minus bonds (`Instruments.isBond`),
mapped to Yahoo tickers via `YahooTickerMap`. 500ms throttle between requests
(`PriceFetchSupport.sleep`).

`PriceFetchScheduler` is the only Spring class in the price layer; `@EnableScheduling` is on
`PortfolioBenchApplication`. Startup runs are on daemon threads so first-run backfill doesn't
block the web UI.

**Adding a Yahoo ticker mapping:** add `internal=YAHOO` to `resources/yahoo-tickers.properties`.
US listings map to themselves; non-US need an exchange suffix (`.L` London, `.PA` Paris, `.AS`
Amsterdam, `.DE` Frankfurt).

**`close` vs `adj_close`:** use `close` for "market value of the position on date X", `adj_close`
for total-return calculations. **`YahooPriceFetcher` re-derives `adj_close` from the
`events.dividends` and `events.splits` stream on every fetch** — Yahoo's bundled `adjclose`
field is only split-adjusted (not dividend-adjusted) for many UK listings, so trusting it
silently understates total return. The backward-walk handles both dividends and splits and
yields a true total-return adj_close. The daily incremental run only refreshes the latest
day, so a new dividend on a held name leaves historical `adj_close` stale — trigger
**Rebuild adj_close** on the dashboard (or `POST /rebuild-prices`) to re-fetch the full
window per ticker and refresh every row via `upsertPriceBars`. The gilt paths (intraday
rollup, Tradeweb batch import) also use `upsertPriceBars`, so latest write wins for
`(symbol, date)` — clean price feeds both `close` and `adj_close` (no total-return math
for bonds).

**Currency is stored verbatim** from Yahoo. `.L` (London) tickers report `"GBp"` (pence);
`PortfolioAggregator.realtime` divides by 100 before producing the RT market value.

**II SIPP cash field (holdings view + Excel export only):** II's holdings CSV export omits the
cash balance, so the dashboard form supplies it as **two separate inputs** — `iiSippCash`
(GBP) and `iiSippCashUsd` (USD). `SyncPortfolioService.combineIiCashAsGbp` converts the USD
portion at the live FX rate it already fetched and sums into the single GBP figure that
flows into `PortfolioMetrics` and the Excel sheet. Both inputs persist in `KeyValueStore`
(`ii_sipp_cash_last`, `ii_sipp_cash_last_usd`). The cash-ledger view, contributions chart,
and value-over-time chart don't use these inputs — they derive II cash from the latest
stored `cash_balance_gbp` per `(account='II', currency)` directly.

## Charts (Contributions, Value-over-time)

Two read-only JSON endpoints feed Chart.js panels:

- **`GET /contributions`** (`ContributionService`) — cumulative GBP per account plus Total.
  Source: `cash_transactions WHERE type = 'CONTRIBUTION'`. RothIRA has no contribution rows;
  the brought-forward seed (USD) is converted to GBP at the FX rate on Roth's earliest
  ledger date and emitted as a single step.
- **`GET /portfolio-value`** (`PortfolioValueService`) — month-end portfolio GBP value.
  Forward-replays the full ledger once, valuing surviving positions at the most recent
  `price_history` close ≤ each sample (with **ceil-fill to the earliest known close** as
  fallback for samples that predate all stored prices). Bonds use the per-£100 formula;
  `GBp` (pence) divides by 100. Roth USD seed folded in on its earliest ledger date.
  Cash FX'd via `HistoricalFxRateProvider` (Frankfurter).

`ValueTimeline.missingPrices` lists symbols ever held with zero rows in `price_history`,
including the date range they were held. The dashboard renders them as a yellow warning
panel above the chart; each one also logs WARN. Dropping any close for the symbol clears
the warning and fills in the dip.

**Yahoo testing:** JSON parsing is unit-tested against `yahoo-nvda-sample.json`; a live-API test
(`YahooPriceFetcherIntegrationTest`) is `@Tag("integration")` and excluded by the surefire
`excludedGroups` property. Run with `mvn test -Dgroups=integration -DexcludedGroups=`.

## Watchlist & alerts (volatility trading)

Monitor-and-nudge tool for opportunistic trimming/rebuying — it emails alerts and never
touches an order.

- `WatchlistRepository` — `watchlist` table (symbol PK + two thresholds + added_at). The
  symbol set is **mirrored** to `KeyValueStore` under `watchlist_symbols` on every mutation,
  so `PriceFetchSupport.tickersToFetch` and `PortfolioFundamentalsService` union watchlist
  names into their fetch universes with no constructor churn — a freshly added symbol gets
  daily + intraday prices and a fundamentals row on the next tick. `WatchlistController.add`
  also kicks an immediate `PriceFetchJob.fetchSingle` + fundamentals refresh in the background.
- `WatchlistService` — assembles each row from one snapshot (single FX fetch, one bulk
  latest-intraday lookup, one ledger read). Position/gain reuse `PositionDetailService`'s FIFO
  engine (same package) rather than re-implementing it. Momentum (Today/2d/3d/5d/10d/30d) is
  **session-anchored** via `PriceStats.closeNSessionsBefore` — `k` "days" = `k` trading sessions,
  so "2d" is the last two sessions (today + the prior session) and the short windows stay distinct
  over weekends (a calendar anchor collapsed Today/2d/3d onto the same Friday close on Mondays).
  The full row and the near-real-time `/watchlist/quotes` poll share one `computeLive` calc so
  they can't diverge; realized vol is `PriceStats.annualizedVol` (30-session sample
  stdev × √252, on split-adjusted `close`, same convention as the Risk tab). 52-wk high/low,
  P/E and beta come from the fundamentals cache. `series()` serves the popup chart: intraday
  for 1D–15D (downsampled to ~5-min beyond 5 days), daily `close×splitFactor` for 30D.
- **Triggers** are pure domain logic (`WatchlistAlerts.evaluate` → `Flags`): (a) within
  `highThresholdPct`% of the 52-week high (a fresh high always fires); (b) `|today's move|` ≥
  `moveThresholdPct`%, either direction; (c) price ≥ `priceAbove` level; (d) price ≤ `priceBelow`
  level. The two price levels are absolute, in the symbol's **native price currency** (compared
  against the same native `currentPrice` the row shows — no FX), at-or-through counts. Screen and
  alert job evaluate identical `Row`s so they never disagree. **No 52-wk-low trigger** — the low is
  displayed but never alerts (watched names have run up too far for it to matter). A **blank/0
  threshold/level disables that trigger** (`WatchlistRepository` stores 0; the columns are
  `price_above`/`price_below`, NULL on rows predating them → read as 0 = disabled), so a symbol can
  be watched with no alerts at all. `both()` (the pulse) stays near-high + big-move only; the alert
  job dedups the price levels under `SYMBOL|ABOVE|date` / `SYMBOL|BELOW|date`.
- **Popup extras:** `GET /watchlist/vol` returns a realized-vol **term structure** (5D/10D from
  intraday 1-min returns via `PriceStats.annualizedVolIntraday`, 30D/1Y from daily closes) shown
  in the popup stats. `GET /watchlist/series` for `1D` returns only the latest session's bars
  (convention: today only); the popup chart uses a **category x-axis** (evenly-spaced) so
  overnight/weekend gaps don't draw diagonal lines — 1D labels are times, multi-day/30D labels
  are dates. Popup fundamentals reuse the Snapshot-diff renderer (`fundamentalsHtml` /
  `fundamentalsFieldGroups` in `dashboard.js`) laid out in columns.
- **Manual order:** `watchlist.display_order` + `POST /watchlist/move?dir=up|down` swap
  neighbours; rows render in that order (↑/↓ buttons per row). Add-backfills run on a
  single-thread executor in `WatchlistController` so two quick adds queue rather than racing
  SQLite writes.
- `WatchlistAlertJob` — runs every 5 min (`PriceFetchScheduler`). Dedups **once per day per
  symbol per trigger** via a KV set (`watchlist_alerts_fired`, keys `SYMBOL|TRIGGER|date`),
  batches a tick's new firings into one email, and only persists the fired-set after a
  successful send (so a mail failure retries). No-op unless SMTP is configured.
- **Email:** `AlertNotifier` port + `SmtpAlertNotifier` adapter (Jakarta Mail directly, kept
  Spring-free like the other adapters; `spring-boot-starter-mail` supplies the library).
  Disabled by default. **Put the Gmail app password in `~/.portfolio-bench.properties`** (home
  dir, outside the repo — `application.properties` loads it via
  `spring.config.import=optional:file:${user.home}/.portfolio-bench.properties`, so it can never
  be committed). Set `portfolio.alert.mail.{enabled=true,username,password,from,to}` there
  (Gmail: `smtp.gmail.com:587`, STARTTLS). The app must be running during market hours for
  alerts to fire — keep the lid open + `caffeinate` (closing the lid sleeps the JVM even under
  caffeinate).

## Swing-strategy validation statistics

Backtesting/statistics tool (Swing stats tab) for validating a short-term mean-reversion
strategy — dip-buy after 1–2 day flushes, exit at a fixed take-profit / wide stop / time stop —
*before* trading it. Read-only: it never touches the ledger or places an order.

- **Pure engine** lives in `com.portfolio.domain.swing` (framework-free, unit-tested like
  `PriceStats`). `SwingConfig` holds every knob (spec defaults); `SwingSeries` pre-computes the
  aligned `close/adjClose/high/low/logRet/simpleRet` arrays, a **look-ahead-free trailing-30d daily σ**
  (σ over returns strictly *before* each bar, so a σ-trigger judges a day against vol known going in),
  and a trailing **`sma[]`** (200d MA, `maWindow`) for the §A/§E regime flag. `preWindowSigma(i,days)`
  = the σ strictly before a flush window (`trailSigma[i-days+1]`), so the flush can't inflate its own σ.
  Engines: `RealizedVol` (§1), `ForwardReturns` (§2/§3/§4), `Flushes` (§5 profile + §6 barrier sim),
  `Placebo` (§6 controls), `ReturnCorrelation` (§7), `FlushEvents` (§A event log), `AnnualBreakdown`
  (§B per-year), `MaSplit` (§E 200d-MA split). `Stats` provides mean/median/quartiles/%pos + a public
  `quantile`. All engines take a `List<SwingSeries>` so the same code serves per-symbol (one) and
  pooled-cluster (concatenate observations across the cluster, equal-weight by observation).
- **Trigger families (§C).** `FlushTrigger` abstracts "does a flush fire at bar `i`" with two impls —
  `AbsoluteFlush` (cum ret ≤ −threshold) and `SigmaFlush` (cum ret ≤ −k×σ×√N, σ = `preWindowSigma`).
  `Flushes` is parameterised by it, so the whole §5/§6/placebo/bootstrap/§A/§B/§E machinery runs for
  the absolute and σ-scaled families **in parallel** over each regime. The σ family fires at each
  regime's own scale, so a low-vol bear (2022) generates events the absolute trigger misses.
  `Flushes.overlapCount` reports the dates both barrier-seed triggers fire (never double-pooled).
- **Conventions:** returns off `close` (split-adjusted), log for vol, simple for anything P&L-like.
  σ-triggers compare the day's simple return to −k×(trailing daily σ); absolute triggers to −p%.
  A 1e-9 epsilon makes round thresholds (a "−10%" day stored as −0.0999999998) register. Small-N
  cells are flagged, never silently averaged (`smallNFloor`); **pooled** cells also report distinct
  event *dates* (episodes) beside the raw event count and flag `episodes < episodeFloor` (cluster
  names flush on shared dates, so 10 symbols × one crash ≈ 1 episode, not 10).
- **§6 event accounting** (the calibration core). Barrier touches are read from **intraday OHLC**
  (TP if session `high ≥ entry×(1+tp)`, SL if `low ≤ entry×(1−sl)`; fills at the barrier, time-stop
  exits at the close). `Flushes.simulateTrade`/`aggregate` are the shared single-trade engine (reused
  by the placebo). Five-way reconciliation holds in every table: **events = TP + SL + Time +
  Ambiguous + Open**. *Ambiguous* = both barriers touched in one session (excluded from the standard
  mean return; a `meanReturnConservative` books each as a stop for a pessimistic bound). *Open* = the
  outcome window runs past the last data date (censored — never dropped, never counted as an
  outcome). §6 events are **non-overlapping until the prior simulated trade resolves** (so the count
  legitimately shrinks as the time stop lengthens); §5 keeps its `flushCooldown` dedup for its
  descriptive profile. `Stats.Dist` and any nullable figure never emit a bare `NaN` — `config/JacksonConfig`
  serializes non-finite doubles as JSON `null` app-wide (empty distributions would otherwise corrupt
  the payload).
- **§6 controls (`Placebo`)** answer "does the flush trigger beat drift?": an **all-days placebo**
  (entry at every fully-evaluable close, overlaps allowed, `open == 0` by construction) and a
  **matched random bootstrap** (draw N = flush-event count random entry dates from that pool,
  `bootstrapIterations` times, seeded by `randomSeed`; reports the %TP / mean-return distribution and
  the percentile rank of the actual flush result — a rank inside the IQR means the trigger adds
  nothing). The bootstrap samples the precomputed placebo pool, so 1,000 iterations are cheap.
- **§A/§B/§E engines.** `FlushEvents` emits one diagnostic row per **cooldown-deduped** event (every
  down-leg, not the §6 non-overlap subset), resolved at `eventLogTimeStop` — cum return, σ-multiple,
  above/below-200d-MA + distance, outcome/exit/return, further drawdown, sessions-to-target, and the
  §D earnings flag; the row set is CSV-exportable in the UI. `AnnualBreakdown` groups events by
  calendar year (outcome counts + mean/median trade return) beside the name's own `adjClose` calendar
  return (pooled = member mean). `MaSplit` partitions §6 outcomes and the placebo pool by entry MA
  state and runs a within-state bootstrap when powered (pool ≥ 100, draws ≥ 5), else flags
  `underpowered`.
- **`SwingAnalysisService`** loads bars, runs every symbol + the pooled cluster over both §9
  regimes (full history + trailing 6 months, rendered **side by side**), and adds §7 correlation.
  Each `SymbolReport` reports its actual data span (`from`/`to`/`yearsAvailable`) and a `shortHistory`
  flag when the first bar post-dates the full-history cutoff. Each `Regime` carries `families` (abs +
  σ) + `familyOverlapCount`; each `FlushFamily` carries two `EarningsVariant`s ("all"/"ex-earnings",
  §D) of the §5/§6 tables (each §6 stop still a `BarrierComparison` of flush + placebo + bootstrap),
  plus the §A event log, §B annual and §E MA split. No FX — statistics are unit-less return ratios, so
  `.L` pence listings need no conversion. `SwingReport` (in `application`) is the JSON DTO;
  `earningsHygiene` is now a real §D coverage summary.
- **Config persistence:** the symbol universe + cluster live in `KeyValueStore` (`swing_symbols` /
  `swing_cluster`, seeded from spec defaults on first read). `swing_symbols` is unioned into
  `PriceFetchSupport.tickersToFetch`, so the nightly 30-year daily job keeps the swing universe
  backfilled automatically; `POST /swing/backfill` (and `POST /swing/symbols` after an edit) covers
  the first-run gap via `PriceFetchJob.fetchSingle` on a background executor. `GET /swing` echoes
  the effective `SwingConfig`; every knob is also an optional query param (percents in, e.g.
  `dropPcts=5,8,10`; σ-family knobs `flushSigmas`/`barrierSigmaK`, plus `maWindow`/`eventWindow`/
  `eventLogTimeStop`) so parameters can be swept without changing stored config.
- **§D earnings hygiene (active).** Earnings dates are proxied by **SEC EDGAR 10-Q/10-K filing dates**
  (submissions API), which land within a few days of the release — good enough for a ±window flag, and
  the only free multi-year source. `port/EarningsCalendarProvider` → `adapter/EdgarEarningsFetcher`
  (hard-coded CIK map for the semi universe's US filers), cached in `persistence/EarningsDateRepository`
  (`earnings_dates` table) so the report never re-hits SEC; `application/EarningsService` composes them
  and builds a per-series `EarningsLookup` (trading-days-to-nearest-earnings per bar). **US filers
  only** — ASML (files 20-F/6-K) and SEMI.L (UK, no SEC) are `isVerifiable == false` and flagged
  **unverified**, never treated as clean. The ex-earnings variant removes events within ±`eventWindow`
  sessions of an earnings date and drops those dates from the placebo/bootstrap pool too, via a
  per-`(symbol,date)` `EventFilter` (date-only would over-exclude ~10× when pooling a cluster). Report
  reads the cache; `report()` and `POST /swing/backfill` warm it best-effort off the request path.
